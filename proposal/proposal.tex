\section{Motivation}

% What is it you are trying to solve?
% Why is it important?
% What is the question that this is trying to solve?

Authoritarianism is a common field of research, especially in the context of global politics and leaders. Yet, there is little prior work investigating how it spreads in and is exercised by common people. This project will analyze the use of authoritarian language by moderators, who have moderation powers in specific "subreddits," on Reddit. The bulk of the work will be testing for correlations to secondary factors including \begin{itemize}
    \item size of subreddit
    \item number of subreddits moderated
    \item comparison to the general non-moderator population---globally and within their specific subreddit
    \item differences in interactions with subreddits the user does/does not moderate
    \item how active a moderator is.
\end{itemize} This offers insights on the psychological aspects of holding a position of power in an online community and how a moderator's diction reflects this.

% TODO:
% This is certainly a bit of stretch and arguably we can't actually make these conclusions with full confidence
% However I'm pretty sure we need more of a justification than just "its cool and interesting"
We will classify language by its relation to that used by authoritarian political figures. This allows us to test whether traditional authoritarian language maps to the power dynamics present within subreddits, and if so, what factors could cause the common person to trend towards authoritarian practices.

\section{Prior Work}

% Nothing in depth at this time (that comes with the Intermediate report writeup), but at least a perusal of what you think are the most relevant papers.
We will center this work around the application of an existing authoritarian language classifier~\cite{classifier}. Also, there is existing work surrounding the Reddit userbase, such as Almerekhi's work on categorizing toxicity~\cite{reddit-toxicity} or Marrazzo's study showing how Reddit's decentralized moderation practices, i.e., delegating subreddit moderation to community moderators, mirrors a federalist governmental system~\cite{federalist}. This is similar in nature to this project's goal of comparing moderator authoritarian language to global authoritarian discourse. Finally, Hendricks has examined how self-proclaimed "authoritarianist communists" users define authoritarianism~\cite{communists}.

\section{Methodology}

% Low-level details aren't strictly needed at this time, but what broadly do you intend to do? Create a new tool? Collect a new dataset? Analyze and existing dataset?

The central work of this project is analyzing existing databases and supplementing it as needed. We will determine authoritarian language of a user from their comments and posts and measured through an existing authoritarian language classifier~\cite{classifier}. We will source these comments and posts through the Pushshift comment dumps and its related API~\cite{pushshift, dump}, with extra required metadata gathered either through other such databases or scraped. We can then measure the text from the Pushshift comment dumps for authoritarian language using the existing classifier~\cite{classifier} to test and draw conclusions. Much of this work will consist of analyzing and testing comments and posts from users who meet specific criteria against those from Reddit moderators.

\section{Evaluation}

% What are your metrics for success? Performance? Privacy? Predictive ability of a new model?
% Will you be comparing to any other prior approaches?
Because this is an open-ended, exploratory problem, we will base evaluation on how holistic the resultant model is by incorporating as many secondary variables as possible. We may also base evaluation on the confidence level of the correlation of variables in the resultant model, as well as how reasonable the results appear when compared to a manual inspection. The goal is to build a conclusion about the trends of authoritarian language in subreddit moderators.
