\section{Motivation}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is it you are trying to solve?
Why is it important?
What is the question that this is trying to solve?

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Prior Work}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nothing in depth at this time (that comes with the Intermediate report writeup), but at least a perusal of what you think are the most relevant papers.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Methodology}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Low-level details aren't strictly needed at this time, but what broadly do you intend to do? Create a new tool? Collect a new dataset? Analyze and existing dataset?

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Evaluation}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are your metrics for success? Performance? Privacy? Predictive ability of a new model?
Will you be comparing to any other prior approaches?
