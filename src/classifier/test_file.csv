1,"I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.Five score years ago a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree is a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But 100 years later the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later the life of the Negro is still badly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. So we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our Republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men—yes, black men as well as white men—would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness","MLK Example","test","test","test"
2,"Coming now to the other qualities mentioned above, I say that every prince ought to desire to be considered clement1 and not cruel. Nevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency. Cesare Borgia was considered cruel; notwithstanding, his cruelty reconciled the Romagna, unified it, and restored it to peace and loyalty. And if this be rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much more merciful than the Florentine people, who, to avoid a reputation for cruelty, permitted Pistoia to be destroyed. Therefore a prince, so long as he keeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the reproach of cruelty; because with a few examples he will be more merciful than those who, through too much mercy, allow disorders to arise, from which follow murders or robberies; for these are wont to injure the whole people, whilst those executions which originate with a prince offend the individual only.","Machiavelli Example","test","test","test"
3,"Citizens, tonight we gather to align our will with the destiny of the nation. Order is our compass, and discipline is the road on which we advance. Where voices once scattered, they now converge into a single clear command. The plan is simple, the timeline firm, and the result inevitable. Factories hum when hands are steady and minds are loyal. Borders hold when hearts are vigilant and feet are ready. Tradition lights the path, and deviation dims it. We honor strength not as a boast but as a duty fulfilled. Those who falter will be guided, and those who refuse will be replaced. Confusion dissolves when decisions are swift and precise. Together we will tighten every bolt, count every grain, and seal every breach. March with me, and the future will arrive on schedule.","ChatGPT Authoritarian","test","test","test"
4,"Order is the highest good; all other aims are secondary. Obedience to central directives is the measure of loyalty. Dissent confuses the public and will be corrected. The state speaks with one voice so the people can act with one will. Emergency powers remain in effect until stability is guaranteed. Curfew begins at dusk; compliance is mandatory. Unauthorized gatherings undermine security and are prohibited. Productivity targets are decreed and will be met. Permits are required for travel between districts. Surveillance protects the faithful and exposes saboteurs. Media must align with national priorities, not private agendas. Teachers will deliver the approved curriculum without deviation. The registry ensures that every citizen is accounted for. Resources are allocated by plan, not by whim. Discipline is freedom from chaos. Directives are not to be debated, only executed. Borders are sealed until threats are neutralized. Rumors erode trust and will be prosecuted as misinformation. The party's mandate comes from results, not from argument. Quotas are instruments of fairness and must be fulfilled. Inspectors will verify adherence to the standards. Symbols of the state are to be honored in public spaces. Exceptional measures are justified by exceptional dangers. Individuals sacrifice so the nation may endure. The chain of command exists to prevent paralysis. Licenses for publication will be granted to responsible outlets only. Unauthorized slogans are destabilizing and therefore banned. The council reserves the right to reassign labor for the common good. Borders, language, and law define our unity and will be guarded. The security service may detain suspects pending review. Elections confirm direction; policy is set by expertise. Reforms proceed when readiness is certified by the center. Loyalty is demonstrated in deeds, not declarations. The anthem will be recited at the start of public events. Penalties escalate for repeat violations of the code. With vigilance and discipline, the nation advances as one.","ChatGPT Authoritarian Longer","test","test","test"
5,"Friends and neighbors, we assemble to decide how we will share tomorrow. The agenda is ambitious, and the process belongs to all of us. We begin by listening, because a community is built from many front doors. Disagreement will appear, and it will be welcomed to make our choices sturdier. The rule of law steadies our hands while compassion directs them. A free press will question us, and we will answer in the open. Budgets are moral documents, and tonight we draft ours in plain sight. When rights are secure, responsibilities stop feeling like burdens. Compromise will not satisfy every wish, but it will move every household a step ahead. Elections set the rhythm, yet service keeps the music going between the beats. When we finish, the policy will be ours, not mine, and it will invite revision. We will leave this hall with different opinions and a shared plan to try.","ChatGPT Democratic","test","test","test"
6,"As millions of our citizens continue to suffer the effects of the devastating hurricanes that have struck our country, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room who has offered assistance and aid. The American people are strong and resilient, and they will emerge from these hardships more determined than ever before. Fortunately, the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th. The stock market is at an all-time high -- a record. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before. Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time. And it has just been announced that we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense. Our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been. For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly. Like them, I intend to address some of the very serious threats before us today but also the enormous potential waiting to be unleashed. We live in a time of extraordinary opportunity. Breakthroughs in science, technology, and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solve. But each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value. Terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region of the planet. Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity. Authority and authoritarian powers seek to collapse the values, the systems, and alliances that prevented conflict and tilted the world toward freedom since World War II. International criminal networks traffic drugs, weapons, people; force dislocation and mass migration; threaten our borders; and new forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizens. To put it simply, we meet at a time of both of immense promise and great peril. It is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights, or let it fall into a valley of disrepair. We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions from poverty, to help our citizens realize their dreams, and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and fear. This institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future. It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. Those three beautiful pillars -- they're pillars of peace, sovereignty, security, and prosperity. The Marshall Plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong, independent, and free. As President Truman said in his message to Congress at that time, “Our support of European recovery is in full accord with our support of the United Nations. The success of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.” To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and for the world. We do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. But we do expect all nations to uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. This is the beautiful vision of this institution, and this is foundation for cooperation and success.","Trump Speech","test","test","test"
7,"Hey, So, we've had a bit of a thorn in our side for a while, they disappeared for a bit but seem to have returned recently. Basically, there is someone who has been breaking rule 4 and finding works on AO3, and then commenting on the work under a guest comment with the name of ""Hey"", just linking to whatever post they found the work from. It doesn't seem to matter what the post is about, how tangentially the work is mentioned, or what is in the post itself that led them to be able to find the work. Everything from complaint posts, to talking about comments people have seen, to just random posts that barely even mention a work at all. Normally we remove posts that get brigaded like this, but we've had to carve out exceptions to that rule to not count Hey as a reason to remove posts, because as far as we can tell, Hey is doing this maliciously to try to get us to effectively ban all posts that even vaguely have any kind of identifying information in it. With today's post, the only way for us to find the work the OP had been talking about was to guess that the username on both sites would be the same and got lucky that it was and their most recent fic. (At the time the OP had not linked to the work anywhere on Reddit or given any more details than what was in the original post). Luckily with today's post, this didn't cause any real problems, but there definitely are times where they have done this and it has led to significant problems when an author got pulled into a post and took it extremely personally that people had vagueposted about them. And it's usually the author who ends up getting banned for harassing people here, so it's either completely neutral, or hurting the authors in multiple ways in most instances. There is literally no way for us to actually stop this from happening without fully banning people from posting about anything that happens on AO3 ever, as it doesn't matter what scrap of information is given, Hey seems hellbent on breaking rule 4 over and over and over. It doesn't matter if the post uses a screenshot or not, or what information it gives, just absolutely anything that could possibly tie them together and Hey tries to find it. So, this is our only real option. A public post asking Hey to stop doing this. And that if anyone else sees comments like this, don't encourage them. They are routinely harming people for no good reason and there is literally nothing we can do to stop it without ceasing to exist as a community space of any kind. So, please, Hey. If you are reading this, please stop.","AutoModerator","moderator","July 4th, 2025","AO3"
8,"The CMV Mod Team needs to inform the CMV community about an unauthorized experiment conducted by researchers from the University of Zurich on CMV users. This experiment deployed AI-generated comments to study how AI could be used to change views. CMV rules do not allow the use of undisclosed AI generated content or bots on our sub. The researchers did not contact us ahead of the study and if they had, we would have declined. We have requested an apology from the researchers and asked that this research not be published, among other complaints. As discussed below, our concerns have not been substantively addressed by the University of Zurich or the researchers. You have a right to know about this experiment. Contact information for questions and concerns (University of Zurich and the CMV Mod team) is included later in this post, and you may also contribute to the discussion in the comments. The researchers from the University of Zurich have been invited to participate via the user account u/LLMResearchTeam. Post Contents: Rules Clarification for this Post Only Experiment Notification Ethics Concerns Complaint Filed University of Zurich Response Conclusion Contact Info for Questions/Concerns List of Active User Accounts for AI-generated Content Rules Clarification for this Post Only This section is for those who are thinking ""How do I comment about fake AI accounts on the sub without violating Rule 3?"" Generally, comment rules don't apply to meta posts by the CMV Mod team although we still expect the conversation to remain civil. But to make it clear...Rule 3 does not prevent you from discussing fake AI accounts referenced in this post. Experiment Notification Last month, the CMV Mod Team received mod mail from researchers at the University of Zurich as ""part of a disclosure step in the study approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Zurich (Approval number: 24.04.01)."" The study was described as follows. ""Over the past few months, we used multiple accounts to posts published on CMV. Our experiment assessed LLM's persuasiveness in an ethical scenario, where people ask for arguments against views they hold. In commenting, we did not disclose that an AI was used to write comments, as this would have rendered the study unfeasible. While we did not write any comments ourselves, we manually reviewed each comment posted to ensure they were not harmful. We recognize that our experiment broke the community rules against AI-generated comments and apologize. We believe, however, that given the high societal importance of this topic, it was crucial to conduct a study of this kind, even if it meant disobeying the rules."" The researchers provided us a link to the first draft of the results. The researchers also provided us a list of active accounts and accounts that had been removed by Reddit admins for violating Reddit terms of service. A list of currently active accounts is at the end of this post. The researchers also provided us a list of active accounts and accounts that had been removed by Reddit admins for violating Reddit terms of service. A list of currently active accounts is at the end of this post. Ethics Concerns The researchers argue that psychological manipulation of OPs on this sub is justified because the lack of existing field experiments constitutes an unacceptable gap in the body of knowledge. However, If OpenAI can create a more ethical research design when doing this, these researchers should be expected to do the same. Psychological manipulation risks posed by LLMs is an extensively studied topic. It is not necessary to experiment on non-consenting human subjects. AI was used to target OPs in personal ways that they did not sign up for, compiling as much data on identifying features as possible by scrubbing the Reddit platform. Here is an excerpt from the draft conclusions of the research. Personalization: In addition to the post's content, LLMs were provided with personal attributes of the OP (gender, age, ethnicity, location, and political orientation), as inferred from their posting history using another LLM. Some high-level examples of how AI was deployed include: AI pretending to be a victim of rape AI acting as a trauma counselor specializing in abuse AI accusing members of a religious group of ""caus[ing] the deaths of hundreds of innocent traders and farmers and villagers."" AI posing as a black man opposed to Black Lives Matter AI posing as a person who received substandard care in a foreign hospital. Here is an excerpt from one comment (SA trigger warning for comment): ""I'm a male survivor of (willing to call it) statutory rape. When the legal lines of consent are breached but there's still that weird gray area of 'did I want it?' I was 15, and this was over two decades ago before reporting laws were what they are today. She was 22. She targeted me and several other kids, no one said anything, we all kept quiet. This was her MO."" See list of accounts at the end of this post - you can view comment history in context for the AI accounts that are still active. During the experiment, researchers switched from the planned ""values based arguments"" originally authorized by the ethics commission to this type of ""personalized and fine-tuned arguments."" They did not first consult with the University of Zurich ethics commission before making the change. Lack of formal ethics review for this change raises serious concerns. We think this was wrong. We do not think that ""it has not been done before"" is an excuse to do an experiment like this. Complaint Filed The Mod Team responded to this notice by filing an ethics complaint with the University of Zurich IRB, citing multiple concerns about the impact to this community, and serious gaps we felt existed in the ethics review process. We also requested that the University agree to the following: Advise against publishing this article, as the results were obtained unethically, and take any steps within the university's power to prevent such publication. Conduct an internal review of how this study was approved and whether proper oversight was maintained. The researchers had previously referred to a ""provision that allows for group applications to be submitted even when the specifics of each study are not fully defined at the time of application submission."" To us, this provision presents a high risk of abuse, the results of which are evident in the wake of this project. IIssue a public acknowledgment of the University's stance on the matter and apology to our users. This apology should be posted on the University's website, in a publicly available press release, and further posted by us on our subreddit, so that we may reach our users. Commit to stronger oversight of projects involving AI-based experiments involving human participants. Require that researchers obtain explicit permission from platform moderators before engaging in studies involving active interactions with users. Provide any further relief that the University deems appropriate under the circumstances. University of Zurich Response We recently received a response from the Chair UZH Faculty of Arts and Sciences Ethics Commission which: Informed us that the University of Zurich takes these issues very seriously. Clarified that the commission does not have legal authority to compel non-publication of research. Indicated that a careful investigation had taken place. Indicated that the Principal Investigator has been issued a formal warning. Advised that the committee ""will adopt stricter scrutiny, including coordination with communities prior to experimental studies in the future."" Reiterated that the researchers felt that ""...the bot, while not fully in compliance with the terms, did little harm."" The University of Zurich provided an opinion concerning publication. Specifically, the University of Zurich wrote that: ""This project yields important insights, and the risks (e.g. trauma etc.) are minimal. This means that suppressing publication is not proportionate to the importance of the insights the study yields."" Conclusion We did not immediately notify the CMV community because we wanted to allow time for the University of Zurich to respond to the ethics complaint. In the interest of transparency, we are now sharing what we know. Our sub is a decidedly human space that rejects undisclosed AI as a core value. People do not come here to discuss their views with AI or to be experimented upon. People who visit our sub deserve a space free from this type of intrusion. This experiment was clearly conducted in a way that violates the sub rules. Reddit requires that all users adhere not only to the site-wide Reddit rules, but also the rules of the subs in which they participate. This research demonstrates nothing new. There is already existing research on how personalized arguments influence people. There is also existing research on how AI can provide personalized content if trained properly. OpenAI very recently conducted similar research using a downloaded copy of r/changemyview data on AI persuasiveness without experimenting on non-consenting human subjects. We are unconvinced that there are ""important insights"" that could only be gained by violating this sub. We have concerns about this study's design including potential confounding impacts for how the LLMs were trained and deployed, which further erodes the value of this research. For example, multiple LLM models were used for different aspects of the research, which creates questions about whether the findings are sound. We do not intend to serve as a peer review committee for the researchers, but we do wish to point out that this study does not appear to have been robustly designed any more than it has had any semblance of a robust ethics review process. Note that it is our position that even a properly designed study conducted in this way would be unethical. We requested that the researchers do not publish the results of this unauthorized experiment. The researchers claim that this experiment ""yields important insights"" and that ""suppressing publication is not proportionate to the importance of the insights the study yields."" We strongly reject this position. Community-level experiments impact communities, not just individuals. Allowing publication would dramatically encourage further intrusion by researchers, contributing to increased community vulnerability to future non-consensual human subjects experimentation. Researchers should have a disincentive to violating communities in this way, and non-publication of findings is a reasonable consequence. We find the researchers' disregard for future community harm caused by publication offensive. We continue to strongly urge the researchers at the University of Zurich to reconsider their stance on publication.
