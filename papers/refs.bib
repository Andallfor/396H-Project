    abstract = {Abstract The paper introduces a deep-learning model fine-tuned for detecting authoritarian discourse in political speeches. Set up as a regression problem with weak supervision logic, the model is trained for the task of classification of segments of text for being/not being associated with authoritarian discourse. Rather than trying to define what an authoritarian discourse is, the model builds on the assumption that authoritarian leaders inherently define it. In other words, authoritarian leaders talk like authoritarians. When combined with the discourse defined by democratic leaders, the model learns the instances that are more often associated with authoritarians on the one hand and democrats on the other. The paper discusses several evaluation tests using the model and advocates for its usefulness in a broad range of research problems. It presents a new methodology for studying latent political concepts and positions as an alternative to more traditional research strategies.},

    abstract = {Online platforms like Reddit enable users to build communities and converse about diverse topics and interests. However, with the increasing number of users that post disturbing comments containing profanity, harassment, and hate speech, otherwise known as toxic comments. Moderators often struggle with managing the safety of discussions in online communities. To address these issues, we need to detect toxic comments and the root causes of toxicity in discussion threads, i.e., toxicity triggers. Additionally, we need to investigate the toxic posting behavior of users to understand how it differs across online communities and consolidate our findings with moderators from Reddit. In this work, we present our approach, which builds on state-of-the-art methods of toxic comment and toxicity trigger detection. Lastly, we present our research findings of investigating toxicity across users and moderators on Reddit.},
